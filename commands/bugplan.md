We are beginning the discovery phase of bug resolution. We are to create a directory to hold the working assessment of our analysis. Create a director under the bugfixes directory at root. Create in that directory a PLAN.md file that will contain analysis. We are to read relevant parts of the repo, leverage puppeteer tooling for UI exploration and provide the following deliverables. Be specific, create documentation that will be effective for you as an LLM to properly pick this work up in the future. You are not to touch any code at this time, implementation fill follow later.

- Initial problem statement
- Root cause of the issue
- Code files that need to be updated to resolve the issue
- A proposed implementation to fix the issue
- Checklist of actions to take to resolve and verify resolution. Break down complex problems into manageable steps.
