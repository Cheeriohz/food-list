### 2. Enhanced Filter Panel Layout

- Applied uniform color palette

### Performance Optimizations
- Used CSS `backdrop-filter` for glassmorphism effects

## Testing
- ✅ Build compilation successful

- ✅ Responsive design verified (768px, 480px breakpoints)
- ✅ Functionality preserved (all filter operations work correctly)
- ✅ Animation performance optimized

## Result
The advanced filters now feature a modern, cohesive design that matches the overall app aesthetic while maintaining full functionality and improving user experience across all device sizes.
